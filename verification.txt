How to very this library:

Connect an AS3935 lightning sensor as specified in README.md.

Flash the serial-detector example (possibly modified to the correct I2C address
and interrupt pin).

  particle flash my_device examples/serial-detector

Watch for events in the serial console. Create some RF activity (I move a cell
phone around the sensor, hopefully while transferring data). Events should
show up in the serial console.
